sf_to_spm(
  sf_obj1,

}
\arguments{
\item{sf_obj1}{a \code{sf} object s.t. its geometries are polygons.}

\item{sf_obj2}{a \code{sf} object s.t. its geometries are polygons.}

\item{method}{a \code{character} specicifying the method to compute the
distance / covariances between polygons. The options are \code{"grid"}
(default) and \code{"hausdorff"}}

\item{n_pts}{a \code{numeric} scalar representing the number of points to
create a grid in the study region on which the polygons in \code{sf_obj}
is observed.  Alternatively, it can be a vector of the same length as
\code{nrow(sf_obj)}.  In this case, it generates the given number of
points for each polygon in \code{sf_obj}. Considering the scenario on
which you also input a \code{sf_obj2}, this argument can be set to be a
list with two positions such that the first position contains the
\code{n_pts} argument for \code{sf_obj1}, and the second position
contains informations about the same parameter but for the
\code{sf_obj2}.}

\item{type}{a \code{character} indicating the type of grid to be generated.
The options are \code{c("random", "regular", "hexagonal")}. For more
details, see \code{\link[sf]{st_sample}}. Similarly to \code{n_pts}, you
can input a two positions list in here too.}

\item{by_polygon}{a \code{logical} indicating wheter we should generate
\code{n_pts} by polygon or for the \code{n_pts} for the whole study
region. Similarly to \code{n_pts} (and \code{by_polygon}), you can input
a two positions list in here too.}

\item{poly_ids}{a \code{list} with two positions, being the first and the
second one a \code{character} vector informing the name of the variable
in \code{sf_obj} and \code{sf_obj2}, respectively, that represents the
polygons unique identifiers. In case this is not informed, we assume the
id of the polygons are given by their row numbers. Note that, if this is
informed, it must be a two positions list.}

\item{var_ids}{a two positions \code{list} containing in each position
either a scalar or vector of type \code{character}, indicating the
(numerical) variables that are going to be analyzed for \code{sf_obj1}
and \code{sf_obj2}, respectively.}

\value{
a \code{sspm} or \code{mspm} object.
