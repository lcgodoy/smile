\usage{
grid_spm(
  sf_obj,
  poly_ids = NULL,
  var_ids = NULL,
  n_pts,
  type = "regular",
  by_polygon = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf_obj}{a \code{sf} object s.t. its geometries are polygons.}

\item{poly_ids}{a \code{character} vector informing the name of the variable
in \code{sf_obj} that represents the polygons unique identifiers. In
case this is not informed, we assume the id of the polygons are given by
their row numbers.}

\item{var_ids}{a scalar or vector of type \code{character} indicating the
(numerical) variables that are going to be analyzed.}

\item{n_pts}{a \code{numeric} scalar representing the number of points to
create a grid in the study region on which the polygons in \code{sf_obj}
is observed. Alternatively, it can be a vector of the same length as
\code{nrow(sf_obj)}. In this case, it generates the given number of
points for each polygon in \code{sf_obj}.}

\item{type}{a \code{character} indicating the type of grid to be
generated. The options are \code{c("random", "regular",
    "hexagonal")}. For more details, see \code{\link[sf]{st_sample}}.}

\item{by_polygon}{a \code{logical} indicating wheter we should generate
\code{n_pts} by polygon or for the \code{n_pts} for the whole study
region.}

\value{
a \code{list}.

\description{
Transforming a \code{sf} into a \code{spm} object (Internal use)
}
\details{
This is a helper function for internal use. It is used within
\code{\link{single_sf_to_spm}} when \code{method = "grid"} is set.
