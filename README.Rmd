The `smile` package for R simplifies the analysis of spatial data. It offers
tools to:

* **Estimate and predicte**: Using a model-based approach, smile treats areal
  data as averages derived from a continuous Gaussian random field. It is
  possible to model point-referenced and areal data jointly.

* **Interpolate**: For straightforward interpolation, smile employs a
  non-parametric method known as simple areal interpolation.

* **Quantify uncertainty:** When dealing with simple areal interpolation and
  knowing the variance of your observations, smile helps you quantify the
  uncertainty associated with the interpolation.

Essentially, smile provides a user-friendly way to explore, model, and
interpolate spatial data with R, offering both model-based and non-parametric
approaches.

The package accompanies a web page (powered by
[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)) and 5 vignettes.
